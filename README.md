- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexsander-glez.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Analytics and Big Data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, SQL and Data Management.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me at the following email address: alejandro.gleziq@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing soccer, and thanks to that, I have developed a deep appreciation for teamwork and respect for my teammates.

My name is Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez Bautista, and I am a graduate in Chemical Engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to delve into the study of data analysis and the application of machine learning techniques in thermodynamic properties, which I explored extensively for my thesis. This experience has provided me with a solid understanding of the intersection between chemical engineering and emerging technologies in data analysis.

Furthermore, I possess a wide-ranging command of various computer tools, including MATLAB, Python, R, and MySQL, which I have effectively utilized in research and development projects. My education has also equipped me with strong knowledge in advanced statistics and mathematics, enabling me to effectively tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in neural networks for practical applications in solving everyday problems, while also learning the C++ programming language to complement my technical skills.

Moreover, I am pleased to inform you that I am fluent in French, proficient in English, and have a basic knowledge of Russian. These languages have enabled me to communicate effectively in international environments and collaborate in multicultural teams.

In addition to the aforementioned computer tools, I have intermediate proficiency in LaTEX, Aspen Plus, and the Microsoft Office suite. These skills have allowed me to efficiently manage complex projects and collaborate effectively in academic teams.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to solve problems and further enhance my professional profile, allowing me to better understand the world around me."
